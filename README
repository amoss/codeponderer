This repository will contain both a toolkit, and tools using it, that perform static code analysis over C, Java and Bash programs.

Installing the C runtime.

For some reason the C runtime inside the antlr distribution does not contain a configure script. No idea why, as the comments in the other files, docs, and forums online seem to indicate that it should. Sadly the build tools are a little distorted under OSX so something like this was necessary to generate the configure script:

 aclocal
 autoconf
 autoheader
 automake
 automake --add-missing
 automake
 autoreconf -ivf

The actual configure needs to setup a reasonable target and architecture:

 ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/installdir --enable-64bit

This will be cleaned up and automated in a later version after I try the same on a linux host.
