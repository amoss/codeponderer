This repository will contain both a toolkit, and tools using it, that perform static code analysis over C, Java and Bash programs.

Installing the C runtime is now automated in the Makefile.
  OSX(lion): This worked ok, I think suitable versions of the build system are installed by default.
  Ubuntu(maybe 10.10): Needed to do apt-get -y autoconf libtool
